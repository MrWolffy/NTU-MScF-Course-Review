## Lecture 2B

### Learning Outcome Questions

> How to account for the cost of inventories and cost of goods sold?

Maching principle. When goods are sold, debit COGS, credit inventories.

To specify the value of inventories, there are four methods: specific identification, FIFO, LIFO, average cost.

> Why there is a need for physical inventory for both inventory recording systems and what are the items to be included in inventory?

- For perpetual inventory system, need to compare with the calculated number.

- For periodic inventory system, need to figure out COGS.

> How is the inventory valued in the balance sheet?

```
book value = min(cost, net realizable value)
NRV = sales price - sales cost
```

> What are the effects on the financial statements if there are errors in inventory valuation?

- In the year when error occurs, affect COGS and net income.

- In the year when error is corrected, also affect COGS and net income.
