# Answers of Learning Outcome Questions and Other Questions (L5-L10)

## Lecture 5

### Learning Outcome Questions

> Explain how the economic consequences of a firm's business activities are summarized in its financial statements.

Business activites are determined by business environment and business strategy. Then business activities are reflected in financial statements through accounting system, which is determined by accounting environment and accounting strategy.

> Discuss the three sources of noise and bias in financial statement reporting.

- noise from accounting rules
- forecast errors
- manager's accounting choices

> Explain how strategy analysis can improve the assessment of a firm's current performance.

It enables the analyst to frame the subsequent accounting and financial analysis better. For example, identifying the key success factors and key business risks allows the identification of key accounting policies. Assessment of a firm's competitive strategy facilitates evaluating whether current profitability is sustainable. Finally, business analysis enables the analyst to make sound assumptions in forecasting a firm's future performance.

## Lecture 6

### Learning Outcome Questions

> What are the potential sources of distortions in asset values?

The definition of asset: assets are resources that a firm **owns or controls as a result of past business transactions** and which can produce **future economic benefits** that are **measurable with a reasonable degree of certainty**.

- ownership / control: ambiguity over whether a company owns an asset
- economic benefits: can economic benefits be measured with reasonable certainty?
- fair values: have fair values of assets declined below book value? are fair value estimates accurate?

> How do we test for asset impairment?

The impairment test should be carried out for the smallest group of assets that has identifiable cash flows, called the cash generating unit (CGU).

> When is it likely that assets may be understated or overstated?
>
>  When is it likely that managers engage in "income smoothing" or "taking a bath"?

- Asset overstatements arise when managers have incentives to increase reported earnings
- Asset understatements arise when managers have incentives to understate reported earnings
- "income smoothing" when the firm is performing exceptionally well
- "taking a bath" when the firm is having a particularly bad year

> What is deferred tax? 
> 
> How do we calcualte deferred tax liability and the effect on taxation expense? 
> 
> Determine the deferred tax effects on accounting adjustments.

Income and expenses are recognised in different periods under accounting standared and tax rules, and cause the book value and tax bases of assets and liabilities to differ giving rise to deferred taxes.

```
DTL of current year = (book value - tax base) * tax rate
```

DTL will be affected when doing accounting adjustments because the accounting adjustment does not affect the tax statements.

> What are the accounting adjustments in relation to overstated or understated depreciation for non-current assets?

1. adjust the book value at the beginning of the year
2. calculate increase in equity and in DTL
3. adjust depreciation expense for current year and book value
4. adjust tax expense, net profit, equity and DTL

## Lecture 7

### Learning Outcome Questions

> What are the difference in accounting for operating and finance leases?

- finance lease: record as leased asset and leased liability, and recognise depreciation and interest
- operating lease: record as expense 
- after 2019.1.1, all accounted as finance leaase

> What are the implications if significant intangible assets are not capitalized? (e.g., R&D, software developments outlays, Brands, etc.)

understate total assets, overstates return on capital (return on assets and return on equity)

> What are the financial statement adjustments when an analyst decides to capitalize R&D expenses?

1. calculate net R&D asset and amortization of current year
2. adjust balance sheet and income statement

> What are the financial statement adjustments when an analyst decides to undo aggressive revenue recognition?

1. sum up unearned revenue and cost corresponding to unearned revenue
2. sum up earned revenue and cost corresponding to eaarned revenue of current year
3. adjust balance sheet and income statement

> Explain the percentage of completion method.
> 
> What are the accounting adjustments when an analyst decides to undo the revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method?

Contract revenue and costs are recognized as revenue and expenses by reference to the stage of completion.

```
C% = costs incurred to-date / estimated total costs
C% = costs to-date / (costs to-date + estimated costs to complete)
cumulative revenue to-date = C% * total revenue = C% * contract price
revenue for current year = delta of cumulative revenue to-date
```

1. calculate percentage of completion of each year
2. calculate revenue and profit each year
3. adjust income statement and balance sheet

### Other Questions

	- debit right of use asset, credit lease payable
- during the lease term:
	- debit lease payable and interest expense, credit cash
	- debit depreciation, credit accumulated depreciation
- for financial statements
	- balance sheet
	- income statement
	- cash flow statement

## Lecture 8

### Learning Outcome Questions

> What are the warning signs of impairment of non-current assets, inventory and accounts receivables?
> 
> What are the accounting adjustments to record additional write-downs of assets?

- declining non-current asset turnover
- declines in return on assets to levels lower than the WACC
- write-downs by other firms in the same industry

<div></div>

- adjust balance sheet
- adjust income statement

> What are the accounting adjustments when an analyst decides to undo distortions resulting from underestimation (or overestimation) of allowances for doubtful accounts, loan losses or deferred tax asset?

Doubtful accounts and loan losses:

1. calculate new balance of allowances and provision
2. calculate change in DTL and OE
3. adjust income statement of current year

DTA:

1. calculate new balance of allowances
2. adjust balance sheet and income statement

> What are the potential sources of liability distortions? Give examples.

- unearned revenues understated through aggressive revenue recognition
- provisions understated
- off-balance debt (e.g., leases)
- post-employment obligations, such as pension obligations, not fully recorded

> When is it likely that liabilities may be understated?

- when the firm has **key commitments that are difficult to value** and therefore not considered liabilities for financial reporting purposes
- when managers have **incentives to show a strong financial position**, or **to boost reported earnings**
- when managers engage in **earnings management**, e.g., recognizing revenue upon receipt of cash, even though not all services have been provided

> What are the adjustments to undo distortions from understatement of deferred revenue liabilities?

1. reduce revenue and increase deferred revenue
2. reduce cost of sales and increase other current assets by the cost of revenue
3. reduce tax expense and DTL

## Lecture 9

### Learning Outcome Questions

> When should a company recognize a provision on its balance sheet? 
> 
> When should it disclose the liability only in the notes to the financial statements, as a "contingent liability"?

A firm should recognize a provision when

1. it is probable that the obligation will lead to a future outflow of cash
2. the firm has no or little discretion to avoid the obligation
3. the firm can make a reliable estimate of amount of the obligation

When an undertain liability does not meet these requirements for recognition, the firm discloses the liability only in the notes to the financial statements, as a "contingent liability".

> What are the accounting adjustments to recognize a provision on the balance sheet?

1. increase non-current liability, decrease DTL and OE
2. in the next year, increase interest expense, decrease tax expense and profit

## Lecture 10

### Learning Outcome Questions

> What are the three ratios in the traditional approach to decompose return on equity (Dupont analysis)? 
> 
> What are the limitations?

```
ROE = net profit margin * asset turnover * equity multiplier
```

> What are the key ratios that analysts use to assess a firm's operating management, investment management and financial management?

- operating management

```
gross profit margin = (revenue - cost of sales) / revenue
EBITDA margin = EBITDA / revenue
NOPAT margin = net operating profit after tax / revenue
```

- investment management

```
Managetment of working capital:
	OWC to sales = OWC / revenue
	OWC turnover = revenue / OWC
	accounts receivable turnover = revenue / accounts receivables
	inventory turnover = cost of sales / inventories
	accounts payable turnover = purchases / accounts payables
	cash conversion cycle = 
		days in inventories + days in receivables - days payables
Management of non-current assets:
	net non-current operating assets =
		total non-current operating assets - 
		non interest bearing non-current liabilities (such as deferred tax)
	net NCOA turnover = revenue / net NCOA
	PPE turnover = revenue / net property, plant and equipment
```

- financial management

```
Liquidity:
	current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
	quick ratio = (cash and cash equivalents + net trade receivables) / CL
	cash ratio = cash and cash equivalents / CL
	operating cash flow raatio = cash flow from operations / CL
Solvency:
	liabilities to equity ratio = total liabilities / shareholders' equity
	debt to equity ratio = (current debt + non-current debt) / equity
	debt to capital ratio = (CD + NCD) / (CD + NCD + equity)
	interest coverage (earning basis) =
		(profit + interest expense + tax expense) / interest expesne
	interest coverage (cash flow basis) =
		(cash flow from operations + interest paid + tax paid) / interest paid
```

> What is common-size statements? (P13)

Reports only percentages.

> What is working capital and operating working capital?

```
working capital = current assets - current liabilities
operating working capital = 
	(current assets - excess cash and cash equivalents) -
	(current liabilities - current debt and current portion of non-current
		debt)
```

> What do liquidity and solvency mean?

- liquidity analysis relates to evaluating current liabilities
- solvency analysis relates to longer tern liabilities

```
sustainable growth rate = ROE * (1 - dividend payout ratio)
dividend payout ratio = cash dividend paid / profit or loss
```
