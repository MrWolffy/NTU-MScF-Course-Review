## Structure

- introduction (L1)
- financial market
	- fixed income market (L2, L3, L4)
	- stock market (L5)
	- market efficiency (L6)
- pricing model
	- risk and return (L8)
	- portfolio theory (L9, L10, L11)
	- CAPM (L12)

## Lecture 1: Introduction to Finance

- Why we need this course
	- this course is on the valuation of financial assets
	- finance is about the bottom of business activities, and the first step of business decision is the valuation of assets
- questions we would like to answer in this course
	- how financial markets determine asset prices?
	- how corporations make financial decisions?
- what to consider
	- return
	- risk
- two major financial markets
	- fixed income markets
	- stock markets
		- characteristics of common stock:
			- residual claim
			- limited liability
			- voting rights
- misconceptions about valuation (P25)
	- a valuation is an objective research for true value
	- a good valuation provides a precise estimate of value
	- the more quantitive a model, the better the valuation

	- DCF
	- relative valuation (mostly used)
