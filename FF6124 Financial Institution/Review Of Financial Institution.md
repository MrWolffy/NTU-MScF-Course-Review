# Review Of Financial Institution

## Chapter 1: Why Study Financial Markets and Institutions?

- Financial Markets
  - Functionality
    - Market efficiency
    - High economic growth
  - Taxomony
    - Bond market
    - Stock market
    - Foreigh exchange market
      - US dollar index: goes up when US dollar gains strength
- Financial Institutions
  - Functionality: Help financial markets work
- Basic framework: equilibrium, supply and demand, search for profits, an approach to financial structure based on transaction costs and asymmetric information.

## Chapter 2: Overview of the Financial System

- Function of financial markets
  - Balance supply and demand
  - Improves economic efficiency
- Segments of financial markets
  - Direct finance
  - Indirect finance

### Direct Finance

- Taxomony
  - Debt markets, equity markets
  - Primary market, secondary market (provide liquidity, establish price for company valuation)
  - Money market, capital market
- Internationalization of Financial markets
  - Foreign bond (denominated in foreigh currency), eurobond (denominated in one currency, but sold in a different market ), eurocurrency (foreign currency deposited outside of home country, like eurodollar)

### Indirect Finance

- Reason
  - Transaction cost (by developing expertise and taking advantage of economies of scale)
  - Risk sharing
  - Asymmetric information
    - Adverse selection
    - Moral hazard (conflict of interest)
- Taxomony
  - Depository institutions: commertial banks and thrift institutions
  - Contractual savings institutions: insurance companies, pension funds
  - Investment intermediaries: finance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, IB

### Regulation

- Reason
  - Increase information to investors
  - Ensure the soundness of financial intermediaries 
    - Restrictions on entry
    - Disclosure
    - Restrictions on assets and activities
    - Deposit insurance
    - Limits on competition
    - Restrictions on interest rates
    - Improve monetary control: reserve requiements

## Chapter 3: What Do Interest Rates Mean and What Is Their Role in Valuation

- Measuring interest rates
- Distinction between real and nominal interest rates
  - $i_r - i - \pi_e$, ex ante because inflation is expected
- Distinction between interest rates and returns
  - Return = current yield + capital gain yield
  - Interest risk, reinvestment risk
  - Duration: $\%\Delta Price = -DUR \times \Delta i / (1 + i)$

## Chapter 4: Why Do Interest Rates Change

### Determinants of Asset Demand

- Wealth: positive
- **Expected return: positive**
- Risk: negative
- Liquidity: positive

### Changes in Equilibrium Interest Rates

- Demand
  - Savings: positive
  - Expected interest rate: negative (because of the decrease of return on current bonds)
  - Expected inflation rate: negative (because real assets are more attractive)
  - Risk: negative
  - Liquidity: positive

- Supply
  - Profitability of investment opportunities: positive
  - Expected inflation: positive (because the real cost of borrowing declines)
  - Deficits: positive
- Case
  - Fisher effect: demand -, supply +, interest rate +
  - Economy expansion: demand +, supply +, bond outstanding + and usually interest rate +

## Chapter 5: How Do Risk and Term Structure Affect Interest Rates?

### Risk Structure

- Default risk
  - Use chart to illustrate default risk between T bonds and corporate bond
  - Baa-Treasury spread as indicator
- Liquidity
- Income tax consideration
  - Municiple bonds and T-bonds (use chart to illustrate)

### Term Structure

- Phenomenon 
  - Interest rates move together
  - Can be upward sloping or downward sloping
  - Typically upward sloping
- Theories
  - Expectation theory: explains 1 and 2, but not 3
  - Market segmentation theory: explains 3, but not 1 and 2
  - Liquidity premium theory

## Chapter 6: Are Financial Markets Efficient?

- EMH
  - $R^e = R^*$ (market equilibrium), $R^{of} = R^e$ (optimal forecast = expectation), so $R^{of} = R^*$
  - Implication: current prices in a financial market will be set so that the optimal forecast of a security’s return using all available information equals the security’s equilibrium return.

- Evidence of EMH
  - Favorable
    - Investment analysts and mutual funds don't beat the market 
    - Price reflects all publicly available info: anticipated announcements don't affect stock price 
    - Price follows random walk
    - Technical analysis cannot bring excess returns
  - Unfavorable
    - Small-firm effect: small firms have earned abnormally high returns 
    - January effect: stock prices to experience an abnormal positive return in  January 
    - Market overaction
    - Excessive volatility: fluctuations in stock prices may be much greater than is warranted by fluctuations in their fundamental value 
    - Mean reversion
    - New information is not always immediately incorporated into stock prices 

## Chapter 7: Why Do Financial Institutions Exist?

### Facts

1. Stocks are not the most important source of external financing for businesses. 
2. Issuing marketable debt and equity securities is not the primary way in which businesses finance their operations. 
3. Indirect finance is many times more important than direct finance.
4. Financial intermediaries, particularly banks, are the most important source of external funds used to finance businesses.
5. The financial system is among the most heavily regulated sectors of economy. 
6. Only large, well-established corporations have easy access to securities markets to finance their activities. 
7. Collateral is a prevalent feature of debt contracts for both households and businesses. 
8. Debt contracts are typically extremely complicated legal documents that place substantial restrictions on the behavior of the borrowers.

## Chapter 8: Why Do Financial Crises Occur and Why Are They So Damaging to the Economy?

- Source: adverse selection and moral hazard



- Dynamics of Financial Crises
  - Stage 1: Initial phase
    - Credit boom and bust
      - Mismanagement of financial liberalization or innovation
      - FI deleverage
      - Economy shrink
    - Asset-price boom and bust
      - Moral hazard increases as firms have little to lose after bubble burst
      - FI deleverage
    - Increase in uncertainty
  - Stage 2: Banking crisis
    - Insolvency, bank panic
  - Stage 3: Debt deflation
    - Asset prices fall, but debt levels do not adjust, increasing debt burdens

- The Great Depression
  - Bubble in stock burst
  - Decline of agriculture

- The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009
  - Financial innovation in mortgage markets
    - CDO, NINJA
  - Agency problems in mortgage markets
  - Asymmetric information in the credit rating process
  - Bubble of housing price

## Chapter 9: Central Banks

- ECB
  - ESCB: for all EU members
  - Policy interest rates: deposit facility rate, refinancing rate, marginal lending facility rate
  - Nonconventional monetary policy: emergency liquidity assisstance, QE
  - ECB itself does not conduct monetary policies, but assigns these tasks to the central banks 
- Fed
  - The Fed is **an independent entity** that is **privately owned** by its member banks 
  - The Federal Reserve Board of Governors (FRB)
  - The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 8 times a year
- BoJ
  - The BoJ lacks the autonomy to influence the yen exchange rate. 
- PBoC
  - The PBoC remains one of the least independent central banks
- Independence of central bank
  - Goal independence which encompasses the institutional characteristics that insulate the central bank from political influence in defining its monetary policy objectives 
  - Instrument independence which refers to the ability of the central bank to freely implement policy instruments in its pursuit to meet the monetary goals

## Chapter 10: Conduct of Monetary Policy: Tools, Goals, Strategy, and Tactics

### Reserves and Convential Monetary Policy Tools

- Two kinds: required reserves, excess reserves
- How Fed affect reserves
  - Open market operations: purchase of bonds increases the money supply
    - Advantage: fed has complete control, flexible and precise, easily reversed, implemented quickly
  - Discount loans: making discount loans increases the money supply
    - 3 types in discount window: primary credit, secondary credit, seasonal credit
    - Last resort function
  - Change required reserves (rarely used)
    - Disadvantage: raising causes liquidity problems for banks, makes liquidity management unnecessarily difficult
- S&D curve
  - Upper limit of supply: discount loan rate
  - Lower limit of demand: open market operation rate

### Nonconvential Monetary Policy Tools

- QE
  - Provide liquidity, prevent deflation, but may cause inflation
  - Achieved its goal, but need long time
  - Lead to bubbles
- Forward guidance
  - By committing to maintain short-term rates near zero, future short-term rates should also be zero, meaning long-term rates fall. 

### Should Central Banks’ Respond to Asset-Price Bubbles?

- 2 kinds of bubbles
  - Credit-driven bubble
  - Optimism-driven bubble
- Reasons of NO
  - Bubbles are difficult to identify 
  - Rate changes may do nothing 
  - Rates are a blunt instrument - affect many asset prices in the economy
  - Resulting slow economy, unemployment, etc., may be worse than the bubble. 
  - Policy reactions after the bubble bursts may keep damage at a reasonable level.
- Reasons of YES
  - Suggests leaning against credit-driven bubbles. 
  - **Macroprudential regulation**: Increase disclosure requirements and capital requirements, prompt corrective action, monitoring risk-management procedures, and close supervision. Countercyclical capital requirements.

## Chapter 14: The Mortgage Markets

- History: balloon loans

- Characteristics of Residential Mortgage
  - Mortgage interest rates: market rates, term, discount points
  - Loan terms: collateral, down payment (piggybank loans), private mortgage insurance, qualifications
  - Mortgage loan amortization

- Sencodary Mortgage Market
  - Securitization of mortgages: Mortgage are too small to be wholesale instrument, not standardised, costly to service, have unknown default risk. 
  - Mortgage-backed security
    - Eliminate idiosyncratic risk but still face prepayment risk

## Chapter 17: Banking And The Management Of Financial Institutions

- The Bank Balance Sheet 
  - Liabilities: checkable deposits, nontransaction deposits, borrowings, bank capital
  - Assets: reserves, cash items in process of collection, deposits at other banks, securities, loans, tangible assets

- General Principles of Bank Management 
  - Interest risk, credit risk

  - Liquidity management: Borrow from other banks, Sell securities, Borrow from the Fed, Reduce loan portfolio 
  - Asset management: higher return, lower risk
  - Liability management: Asset-liability management
  - Managing capital adequacy: ROA, ROE, EM
    - When expanding: increase dividends, When shrinking: retire debt

- Off-Balance Sheet Activities 
  - Loan sales, fee income, trading activities and risk management techniques
  - All these activities involve risk and potential conflicts

- Measuring Bank Performance
  - ROA, ROE, NIM (net interest margin, = [interest income - interest expense] / assets)

## Chapter 18: Financial Regulation

-  Types of Financial Regulation
  1. Restrictions on asset holdings 
  2. capital requirements: leverage > 5%, capital > 8% of risk-weighted assets and off-BS activities
  3. prompt corrective action: “Undercapitalized banks” are subject to greater reporting requirements and regulatory oversight.
  4. chartering and examination: CAMEL rating
  5. assessment of risk management: stress testing, VaR
  6. disclosure requirements: mark-to-market accounting
  7. consumer protection: standardized interest rates, prevent discrimination
  8. restrictions on competition 
  9. macroprudential regulation

- Banking Crisis Throughout the World
  - Financial liberalization leads to bad loans 
  - Deposit insurance is not big enough to cover losses 
  - The government stands ready to bailout the system. 

## Chapter 19: Banking Industry: Structure and Competition

### Financial Innovation and the Growth of the Shadow Banking System 

- Financial innovation
  - Response to Changes in Demand Conditions (interest rate risk): adjustable-rate mortgages, derivatives
  - Response to Changes in Supply Conditions: credit card, ATMs, electronic banking, electronic payment, E-money, securitization
    - Shadow banking: **Loan origination -> servicing -> bundling -> distribution** 
  - Avoidance of Existing Regulation: Money market mutual fund, sweep account
- Decline of traditional banking
  - Decline in Cost Advantages in Acquiring Funds (Liabilities) 
    - As rates rise, disintermediation occurs because: Deposit rate ceilings and reg Q, Money market mutual funds 
  - Decline in Income Advantages on Uses of Funds (Assets) 
    - Easier to use securities markets to raise funds: commercial paper, junk bonds, securitization 
    - Finance companies more important because easier for them to raise funds
- Banks' responses: Expand lending into riskier areas (e.g., real estate), Expand into off-balance sheet activities 

### Bank Consolidation and Nationwide Banking 

- Reason: economies of scale
  - Loophole mining reduced effectiveness of branching restrictions 
  - Development of super-regional banks 

## Chapter 20: The Mutual Fund Industry

- The Growth of Mutual Funds
  - Benefit
    - Liquidity intermediation: investors can quickly convert investments into cash. 
    - Denomination intermediation: investors can participate in equity and debt offerings that, individually, require more capital than they possess. 
    - Diversification: investors immediately realize the benefits of diversification even for small investments.
    - Cost advantages: the mutual fund can negotiate lower transaction fees than would be available to the individual investor. 
    - Managerial expertise: many investors prefer to rely on professional money managers to select their investments.

- Mutual Fund Structure

  **Closed-End Fund**: a fixed number of nonredeemable shares are sold through an initial offering and are then traded in the OTC market. Price for the shares is determined by supply and demand forces. 

  **Open-End Fund**: investors may buy or redeem shares at any point, where the price is determined by the net asset value of the fund.

- Investment Objective Classes
  - Stock funds, bond funds, hybrid funds, money market funds

- Conflicts of Interest in the Mutual Fund Industry
  - Late trading: allowing trades after 4:00 pm to trade at today’s 4:00 NAV instead of tomorrow’s price. This is illegal under SEC regulations. 
  - Market timing: taking advantage of time zone differences for determination of NAV. This is not illegal under SEC rulings.

## Chapter 22: Investment Banks, Security Brokers and Dealers, and Venture Capital Firms

### Investment Banks 

- What do IB do
  - Underwrite the initial sale of stocks and bonds 
  - Deal maker in mergers, acquisitions, and spin-offs 
  - Middleman in the purchase and sale of companies 
  - Private broker to the very wealthy
- Best Efforts: underwriter does not buy the issue, but rather makes its “best effort” to sell the entire issue. 
- Way of hostile takeover
  - Tender offer: take that offer directly to the shareholders, who may choose to accept it if it is at a sufficient premium .
  - Proxy fight: opposing groups of stockholders persuade other stockholders to allow them to use their shares' proxy votes. 
- Defence of hostile takeover
  - Crown jewel: the company's bylaws requires the sale of the most valuable assets, thereby making it less attractive 
  - Poison pill: allows existing shareholders to buy newly issued stock at a discount if one shareholder has bought more than a stipulated percentage of the stock; the buyer who triggered the defense is excluded from the discount.
  - Golden parachute: benefits given to top executives and executives are terminated as a result of merger or takeover 
  - Pac man: the target firm then tries to acquire the company that has made the hostile takeover attempt 

### Security Brokers and Dealers 

- Market order, limit order, short sales

### Private Equity Investments 

- Why go private
  - Avoid SEC regulation, such as Sarbanes-Oxley. 
  - Provides flexibility and ability to avoid public scrutiny of earnings. Also helps attract top talent no longer interested in the life of a public-company CEO. 
  - Tax advantages, and high compensation for partners

## Yield Curve

- Nelson-Siegel model
  - $R(m) = \beta_0 + (\beta_1 + \beta_2)[1 - e^{-m/ \tau}] / (m / \tau) - \beta_2 e^{-m/\tau}$
  - $\beta_0$: long-term component, $\beta_2$: medium-term, $\beta_1$: short-term
- The dynamic Nelson-Siegel model
  - Use AR to find pattern of $\beta$s

##  Fantastic Economic Indicators 

- Types: leading, coincident, lagging
- Criteria: timeliness, accurancy, exoticness, degree of linkage to the real economy or the practical world of investing
- GDP = C + I + G + NX
  - C: automobile sales, consumer sentiment, existing home sales, underemployment
  - I: book-to-bill ratio, copper price, durable goods orders, housing permits and starts, PMI
  - G: deficits and national debt
  - NX: Baltic dry index, big mac index, current account dificit. oil inventories
  - Multiple components: crack spread, federal funds rate, fertility rates, LIBOR, M2 money supply, new home sales, real interest rates, short interest, Russell 2000, yield curve

- Absorption ratio based on PCA
- Crowded trades

## Pair Trade

- Trade
  - Spread > +- 2 standard deviation, open
  - Spread < +- 0.5 standard deviation, close
