## Introduction

- Market value = fundamental + non-fundamental

- EMH
  - Assets are fairly priced (no excess return, required return = expected return)
  - Prices reflect all available information

### Fundamental approach

- Assumptions
	- Markets are not necessarily efficient all the time
	- We can find mistakes by using right valuation models
	- Markets will correct mistakes over time
	- (Notice there are non-fundamental factors, so good company doesn't mean good stock)
- Approaches
	- DCF valuation
	- Relative valuation
	- OPM valuation
