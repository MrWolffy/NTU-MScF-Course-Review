### Overview

| Models | Cash Flow | Discount Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dividend Discount Model | Dividends | Cost of equity |
| FCFE Discount Model | FCFE | Cost of equity |
| FCFF Discount Model | FCFF | WACC |

- DDM, FCFE: equity value
- FCFE: firm value (value of operating assets)
- Principle: consistency (CF and discount rate, nominal and real, currency)

### Cash Flow

- Adjust operating cash flows (EBIT) and net income
  - Update earnings
  - Exclude non-recurring CF items and financing expenses (reason: considered in discount rate)
    - \+ operating lease expenses, - depreciation on leased asset
  - Exclude earnings from non-operating assets (reason: we are measuring operating cash flow)
  - Adjust for mis-classified (OL and R&D expenses) accounting items
    - \+ R&D expenses, - amortization of R&D asset

```
FCFF = EBIT(1 - tax) - (net capex + ∆WC)
```

- Tax rate
	- Effective: taxes can be deferred forever, too liberal
	- Marginal: cannot defer tax, too conservative
	- Start with effective in early years, then move to marginal rate
- Net capex = capex - depreciation
  - \+ R&D expenses, - amortization of R&D asset
  - \+ acquisition of other firms - amortization of such acquisitions
  - Net capex + change in WC = $capital investment
- Working capital = current asset - current liability
  - In finance, only consider operating purpose, so use operating working capital instead
- Net operating working capital = (current asset - cash - securities held for sale) - (current liability - interest-bearing debt)
  - Negative NOWC: using too much trade credit, whose opportunity cost is cash discount (very expensive)

```
FCFE = net income - [(net capex + ∆WC) + 
	(priciple repayments - new debt issues)] - preferred dividends
```

- FCFE > dividend often, because:
  - Desire for stability, future investment needs, tax factors, signaling prerogatives
  - FCFE means potential dividends
- For firm with stable leverage, 𝛅 = debt / capital ratio
	- Net borrowings = 𝛅 * (net capex + ∆WC)
	- FCFE = net income - (1 - 𝛅) * (net capex + ∆WC)

```
dividend + stock buybacks
```

### Discount Rate

$$k_j = k_{RF} + [k_m - k_{RF}] \beta_j$$

- Risk-free rate: no reinvestment risk and no default risk
	- RF rate = YTM of government bond - default spread
	- Match the duration of risk-free rate with the duration of analysis (generally long term)
	- General rule: use the most liquid long-term government bonds and current default spreads (**current risk-free rate**)
- Market risk premium: 2 methods
  - Historical risk premiums: $k_j = k_{RF} (\mathrm{current}) + [k_m - k_{RF}] (\mathrm{historically\ over\ same\ period}) \times \beta_j$
    - Sensitive to: estimation period, T-bill or T-bond rates, geometric or arithmetic averages
    - Operation
      - Estimation period: go back as far as you can (because more accurate and maybe cycle)
      - RF rate: consistent with the one used to calculate $k_j$
      - Average calculation: for next year use arithmetic, for compounding use geometric
    - Problem: backward looking, noisy, selection bias, need long periodical data
  - Implied equity risk premiums
  	- $cost\ of\ equity = R_f (\mathrm{current}) + equity\ beta \times [E(R_m) (\mathrm{expected}) - R_f (\mathrm{current})]$
  	- Use DCF for market to get $$E(R_m)$$, then substract $R_f$ to get MRP
  	- Advantage: forward looking, don't need long historical data, closer to CAPM theory
  	- Disadvantage: it assumes that market is fairly valued, implied MRP is not as subjective as you think
  	- Location of $R_m$: business location or trading location
- Estimating beta
	- Regression method: regress $R_j = a + b R_m$
		- Indicators: R^2 (proportion of market risk), Jensen's alpha = a - Rf(1 - b) (excess return)
		- Operation
		  - Estimation period: 2 to 5 years
		  - Return interval: daily, weekly, monthly (include dividend only in ex-dividend month)
		  - Market return: dividend inclusive over the same return interval
		- Problems: high standard error, backward looking
	- Bottom-up method
		- Implication: beta of equity is determined by business risk and financial risk
		- Process: $$\beta_L$$ from other companies, $$\beta_U$$ for industry, $$\beta_L$$ for target company using $$\beta_L = \beta_U[1 + (1 - t)(D/E)]$$ (assuming $\beta_{debt} = 0$)
		  - If the company has multi sectors, take a weighted average based on weight of value
		- Adjust for cash: $$\beta_U(OA) = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{Cash}{FV}} \times \beta_U(Firm)$$, assuming cash has zero beta
		- Advantage: smaller standard error, can adjust for changes of business, don't need historical data
	- Accounting beta

$$WACC = w_d k_d (1-t) + w_p k_p + w_e k_e$$

- Weights: weight of **market values**
	- Debt: any interest-bearing liability and any lease obligation
	- Convertible bond: break into bond and equity
- Cost of debt
  - Estimate
  	- If firm's bonds are publicly traded: YTM
  	- If firm is rated: risk-free rate + DRP
  	- If firm is not rated: synthetic rating
  	- Interest rate on recent long-term bank borrowing
  - Consistent in currency with cost of equity and cash flow
    - How to handle mismatch problem
      - Use relative method: $k_{d(R\$)} = (1 + k_{d(US\$)}) \frac{1 + inf_{R\$}}{1 + inf_{US\$}} - 1$
      - Change risk-free rate
- Cost of preferred stock: $$k_p = D_p / P_0$$
- Convertible bond: break down into bond and equity

### Economic Value Added (EVA)

- Three ways to measure performance: Jensen's alpha, excess return = E(r) - required return, EVA
- EVA measures the dollar surplus value created by a firm on its existing investment
- Accounting profit is not a good measure of the profitability of company
  - For equity financing there is cost, but the cost is included in NI

```
EVA = NOPAT - dollar cost of capital
EVA = EBIT(1 - T) - WACC * TOC
```
- NOPAT: net operating profit after tax, = EBIT(1 - t)
- Total operating capital (TOC) = total net operating assets = NOWC + net fixed assets, NOWC = OCA - OCL
- Total operating capital = total capital - non-operating assets (easier)

### Growth

- Fundamental growth
  - Investment driven growth: how much reinvest for future growth and the quality of  reinvestments
  - Efficiency driven growth: efficiency gained from changes in return on assets-in-place, has limit
- Growth of DPS
	- $$g_{EPS} = b \times ROE_{t+1} + [ROE_{t+1} - ROE_t] / ROE_t$$ where b = reinvestment ratio
	- $$g_{DPS} = g_{EPS}$$ if payout ratio = constant, as DPS = EPS * b
- Growth of FCFE
	- $g_{net\ income}$ can be different from $g_{EPS}$, as company can issue new shares
	- $$g_{net\ income} = ERR \times ROE + (\% \Delta ROE)$$ where ERR = [(net capex + ∆WC) - (new debt issues - debt repaid)] / net income (equity reinvestment rate)
	  - Note that ERR != b: (1) ERR = $Equity / NI, b = RE = NI, (2) ERR can be greater than 1, by issuing new equity
	- $$g_{FCFE} = g_{NI}$$ if ERR = constant, as FCFE = NI * (1 - ERR)
	- If stable leverage, ERR = (1 - 𝛿)(net capex + ∆WC) / NI where 𝛿 = debt ratio
- Growth of FCFF
	- $$g_{EBIT} = RR \times ROC_{t+1} + (ROC_{t+1} - ROC_t) / ROC_t$$ where $RR = (net\ capex + ∆WC) / EBIT(1 - t)$ and $ROC_{t+1} = EBIT(1-t) / (BV\ of\ capital)$
	  - RR can be > 1, implies FCFF < 0
	- $$g_{FCFF} = g_{EBIT}$$ if RR & tax rate = constant, as FCFF = EBIT(1 - t) * (1 - RR)
	  - Also EBIT = revenue * EBIT margins, can also forecast EBIT margins

### Terminal Value

- Liquidation value
  - Liquidation value < going concern value, because value = asset-in-place + PVGO, and liquidation value = asset-in-place
- Relative valuation
- DCF valuation
  - Stable growth rate <= growth rate of economy, and can be negative
  - Proxy of growth rate of economy is risk-free rate
  - $RR_{stable} = \frac{g_{stable}}{ROC_{stable}}$, which means efficiency driven growth = 0 in stable growth period
  - For ROC, mature firm can also have excess return
    - Management
    - Competitive advantage

### Closure

- Cash & marketable securities
	- Exclude from valuation of operating assets
	  - The cash flow should be before interest income from cash and securities
	  - Discount rate should not include cash. Use cash-adjusted beta to estimate cost of equity
	- Add back to value of operating assets
	- Other non-operating assets: include minority holdings in equity investments, associate companies, joint ventures
- Debt
  - Include interest bearing liabilities and leases, but exclude accounts payable and supplier credit
- Off balance sheet liabilities
	- ESOS (employee stock option) liability
		- Company bears the cost of ESOS
		- OPM approach: pricing by B-S model
		  - Problem: overestimate the liability
		    - The employee loses the 'time value' of option when it is exercised
		    - The option value are already capitalized and amortised
		    - ESOS expenses are considered as employee expenses and thus are tax-deductible
		- After-tax option liability method
		  - Intrinsic value of outstanding vested options * (1 - tax)
	- Pension fund liability, legal liability, others
- Cross-holdings
	- Investments and minority interests: DCF valuation, relative valuation, market values, book values
	  - Input for DCF of minority interests may not be available

```
Value of operating assets + Cash & marketable securities + Non-operating assets - Debt - Off balance sheet liabilities - Minority interests = Value of common equity
```

### Choice of DCF Model

- Use equity valuation: if equity (stock) is being valued
  - Use DDM for (a) high dividend yielding stocks; (b) firms where FCFE are difficult to estimate (banks, firms with unstable leverage)
  - Use FCFE model for (a) firms where dividends are not available (private firms, IPOs); (b) firms that pay very low dividends (relative to their FCFE)
- Use firm valuation
  - If you are more interested in valuing the firm than the equity
  - If you are valuing equity indirectly

### Discussion

- Why market value is different from DCF estimate: each one has different expectation
- Why market is less optimistic than you: information, sentiments (non-fundamental)
- Most likely, you and the market are both wrong, because we assume that market is not efficient all the time
- If you find market value is lower than your estimation, can only conclude share is undervalued only if your valuation is right
- Comparison of DDM and FCFE
  - When are they similar: dividends = FCFE, or FCFE > dividends but excess cash are invested in zero NPV projects
  - When are they different: (1) FCFE > dividends, (2) the payment of small dividends may lead to a lower debt ratio and a higher COC, causing a loss in value, (3) different growth rate of FCFE and dividend
  - DDM can't value non-dividend paying or low-dividend paying stocks, and is too conservative
  - DDM value is the market value of the firm, FCFE value is the market value of operating asset
  - If p = probability of a change in firm's dividend policy, then: market price = p * FCFE + (1 - p) * DDM

### Present Value of Growth Option

- $P_0 = PVNG + PVGO$

- $PVNG = \frac{E_1}{k_s}$ if payout = 100% and g = 0 (ks = cost of equity)

- $PVGO = P_0 - \frac{E_1}{k_s}$
  - If PVGO < 0, means the stock is mispriced

- PVNG = value of asset-in-place

### Adjusted Present Value Approach

Value of levered firm (operating assets) = value of unlevered firm (operating assets) + PV of tax benefits - PV of bankruptcy costs

- Debt benefits: lower cost, descipline your manager, tax benefit
- Debt cost: financial distress cost, agency cost

- Value of unlevered firm
  - FCFF
  - Cost of equity (using unlevered beta)
  - Terminal value
- PV of tax benefits
  - If constant: t * D
  - If not constant: $PV(TB) = \frac{t \times k_1 D_1}{(1 + k_1)} + \frac{t \times k_2 D_2}{(1 + k_1)(1 + k_2)} + \cdots + TV$

- PV of bankruptcy costs = probability * BC
  - Probability
    - Bond rating
    - From bond prices
    - KMV model or CreditMetrics model
  - Bankruptcy cost
    - Direct cost: small
    - Indirect cost: substantial, 25%-30% of firm value

- APV method and COC method may not generate the same estimate, because their assumptions may be inconsistent.
